# Ternary-Trie-Test-Cases
Personal Test cases for Purdue's CS251 (Data Structures) project 5, Ternary Tries.

Some projects for the course do not have public test cases that get released. This leaves many students struggling to understand
exactly where and why their code is failing. Since I tend to finish projects on the same day that they get released rather
than waiting until the end, I usually create and post public test cases so that other students don't have to have the same struggle
that I did. These are one of such test cases.
